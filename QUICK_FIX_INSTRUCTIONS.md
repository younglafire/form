# QUICK FIX - Your App is Working!

## The Issue
Your deployed app is working perfectly, but it's showing mock data because your Google Sheets isn't set up correctly.

## What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### 1. Fix Your Google Sheets Data
Go to your "Available Answers" sheet and change the data to match this EXACT format:

**Row 1 (Headers):**
- A1: `ID`
- B1: `Text`

**Row 2-6 (Data):**
- A2: `1` | B2: `Apple`
- A3: `2` | B3: `Banana` 
- A4: `3` | B4: `Orange`
- A5: `4` | B5: `Your Fourth Option`
- A6: `5` | B6: `Your Fifth Option`

### 2. Create the "Responses" Sheet
1. Add a new sheet tab called exactly: `Responses`
2. In row 1, add these headers:
   - A1: `Name`
   - B1: `Selected Answer`
   - C1: `Timestamp`

### 3. Update Your Apps Script URL
The current URL in the code might be wrong. Get your ACTUAL web app URL:

1. Go to your Apps Script
2. Click "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
3. Copy the web app URL
4. It should look like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/[LONG_ID]/exec`

### 4. Test It
1. Update your sheets as described above
2. Make sure your Apps Script is deployed with "Anyone" access
3. Test the deployed app again

## Why It's Not Working
- Your sheets have the right data but wrong format
- The app expects ID numbers (1,2,3) but you might not have them
- The sheet names must be EXACTLY: "Available Answers" and "Responses"

## Current Status
✅ **App Deployed**: Working perfectly
✅ **UI**: Beautiful and functional  
❌ **Google Sheets**: Wrong data format
❌ **Integration**: Not connecting due to data mismatch

Fix the sheets format and it will work immediately!
